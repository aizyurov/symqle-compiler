keep in model imports for explicit methods - need to create factory methods in abstract classes
method modifiers for explicit methods (may be private! - check that it does not go to the model
    and does not go to Simqle!)
implementation imports for explicit methods
naming convention (sun-confoming):
    public interface SelectStatement
    public abstract class AbstractSelectStatement
ClassDef:implementedInterfaces is Map<Type, int) : type -> priority
    default priority is 0.
Class enhancement: signature -> (MethodDefinition, priority). Lowest priority wins
